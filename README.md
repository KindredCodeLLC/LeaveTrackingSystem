🗂️ Leave Tracking System (Case Study)

Welcome to the Leave Tracking System case study!
This project demonstrates how to use Java object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts to build a practical application that manages employee leave requests.


🚀 Project Overview

The Leave Tracking System simulates a real-world HR application where employees can request leave, managers can review requests, and the system maintains leave balances and history.


🛠️ Features

Submit leave requests

Validate leave balances before approval

Approve or reject requests as a manager

Track employee leave history

Console-based user interface


📚 Key Concepts

Classes & Objects – model employees, leave requests, and managers

Encapsulation – control access to employee and leave data

Inheritance – extend functionality across different employee roles

Polymorphism – process leave requests flexibly

Abstraction – simplify implementation with clean interfaces
